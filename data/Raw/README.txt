dybObs10quad10_1 has 10 varying-size dynamic obstacles and 10 quadrotors. MIGHT NOT BE GOOD, AS MAX NUMBER OF ITERATIONS WERE BEING REACHED CONSISTENTLY FOR THE LAST PART OF THE DATASET
dybObs6quad10_3-4 are datasets with 6 dynamic obstacles and 10 quadrotors, but with goals only changing once they are reached by the quadrotor.
dybObs6quad10_1 and _2 are datasets with 6 dynamic obstacles and 10 quadrotors. Goals where changed when they were in risk on conflicting with an obstacle, so they change too often. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR TRAINING
staticObs6quad10_x are datasets with 6 static obstacles and 10 quadrotors
obsfree files are datasets produced with Dr. W. HÃ¶nig's global planner
goalSequence16quads1, dynamic16quads[...] are datasets with 16 quadrotors and no obstacles
goalSequence6quads1, goalSequence8quads1 are datasets with 6 and 8 quadrotors, respectively, and no obstacles
basicHighInteraction, basicNormalInteraction, goalSequence1-8 are datasets with 4 quadrotors and no obstacles
